## Overview
War3TFT Switcher is a legacy utility created to simplify version switching for **Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne** players on the Garena platform (garena.sg).  

Online players faced a major challenge: Garena required specific game versions, forcing users to maintain multiple full installations of Warcraft III. Existing free tools at the time moved **1.5–2 GB of data** per switch, taking **5–10 minutes** to complete.

To solve this, War3TFT Switcher was developed in **Visual Basic (VB)**, enabling version changes in **under 10 seconds** without duplicating entire game folders.
